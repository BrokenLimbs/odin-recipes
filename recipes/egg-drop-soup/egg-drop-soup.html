            <h3>Rich in flavour and great for any hangover!</h3>
                <p>
                Egg-drop soup is the most easy to make soup. While it does lack
                complexity in the ingredients department, it is exactly that what
                makes it a great soup for beginners to try. It is also great at
                leaving you feeling full without upsetting your stomach with a lot
                of <em>spices and condiments.</em>

                If you <strong>love</strong> eggs and mushrooms as much as I do, 
                I bet your bottom dollar you will be making this every weekend 
                for family and friends.
